Keep track of your clock-in and clock-outs from work.

## Motivation
Currently my work offers a very bad website to allow employees to check they
clock-ins, clock-outs, hours worked and overtime. It constantly calculate
hours incorrectly, besides having zero flexibility for people that work on
differently schedules.

So the idea here is to implement a simple to use, and initially very basic, web
page that calculates how many hours you worked in a day, and presents this
information, alongside you arrival and departure time from work, in a clean
manner.

Also I wanted to learn WebComponents.

## Planned features
+ Add arrival and departure hour for the day
+ Calculate worked hours
+ Display this information in a clean timeline
+ Multiple days
+ Add input for rest hours
+ Add custom value multiplier to hour in certain ranges
